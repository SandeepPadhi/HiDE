finaldemofinal.html is the main web page displaying main UI
signup.html is for signup page

serverCfinal.js is the main server

Only serverCfinal.js needs to be run.
Take care of port nos and ip addresses ..change  it as per your requirement

Try running the app directly and see its functioning

hello.c are created by the server during compilation process when user wants to compile a C code.For java and python similar files are present.

Others files are created by me during external evaluation to show file creation.
